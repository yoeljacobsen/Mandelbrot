# Mandelbrot Set Explorer Specification

This document outlines the specification for a Mandelbrot set explorer application, inspired by the features of the online tool available at [https://weitz.de/mandelbrot/](https://weitz.de/mandelbrot/).

## 1. Core Features

*   **Mandelbrot Set Generation:** The application will generate and display the Mandelbrot set.
*   **Zooming:** Users can zoom into the Mandelbrot set by selecting a region with the mouse.
*   **Panning:** Users can pan the view by clicking and dragging the mouse.
*   **Iteration Control:** Users can adjust the maximum number of iterations for the Mandelbrot calculation. This will affect the level of detail in the generated image.
*   **Color Palettes:** The application will provide a selection of color palettes to render the Mandelbrot set.

## 2. User Interface (UI)

The application will have a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following components:

*   **Main View:** A large area to display the Mandelbrot set.
*   **Control Panel:** A panel with controls for:
    *   **Iterations:** A slider or input field to adjust the maximum number of iterations.
    *   **Color Palette:** A dropdown menu or a set of buttons to select a color palette.
    *   **Reset Button:** A button to reset the view to the initial state.
    *   **Save Button:** A button to save the current view as an image file (e.g., PNG).
*   **Status Bar:** A bar at the bottom of the window to display information such as the current coordinates of the center of the view, the zoom level, and the time taken to generate the image.

## 3. Technical Requirements

*   **Language:** The application will be written in Nim.
*   **GUI Library:** A suitable GUI library for Nim will be used (e.g., Nim GTK).
*   **Performance:** The application should be performant, with optimizations for generating the Mandelbrot set quickly. This may include using multiple threads to parallelize the calculations.
*   **Cross-Platform:** The application should be designed to be cross-platform, with the initial focus on Linux.

## 4. Future Enhancements

*   **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic:** Implement support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic to allow for "infinite" zooming into the Mandelbrot set.
*   **Julia Set Mode:** Add a mode to explore Julia sets corresponding to points in the Mandelbrot set.
*   **History:** A history feature to go back and forth between previous views.
*   **Configuration Files:** The ability to save and load the current settings (e.g., coordinates, zoom level, color palette) to a file.
