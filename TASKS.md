# Mandelbrot Set Explorer Tasks

This document lists the tasks required to develop the Mandelbrot set explorer, as outlined in the `SPEC.md` file.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

-   [x] **Project Setup:**
    -   [x] Initialize a new Nim project.
    -   [ ] Create a Makefile for building the project.
    -   [ ] Create and maintain a README.md file.
    -   [x] Set up a basic project structure with `src` and `tests` directories.
-   [x] **Mandelbrot Logic:**
    -   [x] Implement the core Mandelbrot set calculation logic.
    -   [x] Create a data structure to store the generated Mandelbrot set data.
-   [x] **Basic GUI:**
    -   [x] Choose and set up a GUI library (NiGui).
    -   [x] Create a basic window with a drawing area.
    -   [x] Render the Mandelbrot set to the drawing area.

## Phase 2: User Interaction

-   [ ] **Zooming:**
    -   [ ] Implement mouse selection to define a zoom region.
    -   [ ] Update the view to the selected region.
-   [ ] **Panning:**
    -   [ ] Implement click-and-drag mouse functionality for panning.
    -   [ ] Update the view based on the panning action.
-   [ ] **Iteration Control:**
    -   [ ] Add a slider or input field to the GUI to control the number of iterations.
    -   [ ] Update the Mandelbrot calculation to use the specified number of iterations.

## Phase 3: Visuals and Usability

-   [ ] **Color Palettes:**
    -   [ ] Implement a selection of color palettes.
    -   [ ] Add a dropdown menu or buttons to the GUI to switch between palettes.
-   [ ] **Control Panel:**
    -   [ ] Create a dedicated control panel for all the UI controls.
-   [ ] **Status Bar:**
    -   [ ] Add a status bar to display information like coordinates and zoom level.
-   [ ] **Reset and Save:**
    -   [ ] Implement the "Reset" button to go back to the initial view.
    -   [ ] Implement the "Save" button to save the current view as a PNG image.

## Phase 4: Performance and Refinements

-   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    -   [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
    -   [ ] Implement multi-threading to speed up the Mandelbrot calculation.
-   [ ] **Code Refactoring:**
    -   [ ] Review and refactor the code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
    -   [ ] Add comments and documentation to the code.

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

-   [ ] **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic:**
    -   [ ] Integrate a library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
    -   [ ] Update the Mandelbrot calculation to use high-precision numbers.
-   [ ] **Julia Set Mode:**
    -   [ ] Implement the logic for generating Julia sets.
    -   [ ] Add a UI element to switch between Mandelbrot and Julia set modes.
-   [ ] **History:**
    -   [ ] Implement a history mechanism to store previous views.
    -   [ ] Add "Back" and "Forward" buttons to the GUI.
-   [ ] **Configuration Files:**
    -   [ ] Implement saving and loading of application settings to a configuration file.
